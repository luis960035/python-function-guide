# python-cool-features

A gentle guide to Python features that I didn't know exist or was too afraid to use. Will be updated as I learn more and become less lazy.

## 1. Lambda, map, filter, reduce
## 2. List manipulation
## 3. Classes and magic methods
## 4. local namespace, object's attributes
## 5. Wild import
